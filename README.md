# feseR: Feature Selection in R

## Introduction

We provide here a R package which combine multiple Feature Selection (FS) methods in a workflow for analizing high-dimentional omics data. The different feature selection steps can be classificated in: i) Univariate (Correlation filter and Gain Information), ii) Multivariate (Principal Component Analysis and Matrix Correlation based) and iii) Recursive Feature Elimination (wrapped up with a Machine Learning algorithm, e.g. Random Forest). The goal is to essemble the different steps in an efficient workflow to perform feature selection in the contex of classification and regression problems.

## How to install

The first step is to install `devtools`:

```         
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Then, we can install the package using:

```         
install_github("enriquea/feseR")
library(feseR)
```

## How to use

We provide [here](https://github.com/enriquea/feseR/blob/master/vignettes/feser.pdf) some examples for illustrating how to use the package.
